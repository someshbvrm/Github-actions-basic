# ----------------------------------------------------
# Example GitHub Actions Workflow: Using Variables
# ----------------------------------------------------
# This workflow demonstrates how to:
#  1. Define environment variables at different levels
#  2. Access them inside jobs and steps
#  3. Print values using shell commands
# ----------------------------------------------------

name: Demo - Using Workflow Variables

# Trigger workflow manually from GitHub UI
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

# Global environment variables (available to all jobs)
env:
  GREETING: "Hello"

jobs:
  show_greeting:
    # Each job runs on a virtual machine provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Job-specific environment variables (override or add to global ones)
    env:
      USER_NAME: "Somesh"

    steps:
      # Each step can also have its own environment variables
      - name: Display Welcome Message
        run: echo "$GREETING, I am $USER_NAME, learning $TOPIC"
        env:
          TOPIC: "GitHub Actions Workflows"
